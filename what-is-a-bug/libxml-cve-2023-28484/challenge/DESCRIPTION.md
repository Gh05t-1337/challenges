Bugs often rear themselves in sparcely-maintained, but prominently used infrastructure.
Often, such infrastructure takes the form of small, little-known libraries handling specific functionality for larger, well-known projects.
One such example is [libcue](https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue) and [CVE-2023-43641](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/coordinated-disclosure-1-click-rce-on-gnome-cve-2023-43641/).

In real life, the actual attack vector was a part of gnome.
Here, we've provided the `parse_cue` program.
Understand this bug, understand the software around it, and trigger the crash.
If you can segfault `parse_cue` (when invoked via `/challenge/check`), you will earn the flag!
