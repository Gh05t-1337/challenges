Bugs often rear themselves in sparsely-maintained, but prominently used infrastructure.
Often, such infrastructure takes the form of small, little-known components that handle specific functionality for larger, well-known projects.
One such example is [sudo](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo) and [CVE-2021-3156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156).

In real life, the faulty behavior was in sudo's argument/unescape handling.
Here, we've provided the `sudo` program (source build installed inside the container).

Understand this bug, understand the surrounding code, and trigger the crash.
If you can segfault `/challenge/bin/sudo` (when invoked via `/challenge/check`), you will earn the flag!
