Bugs often rear themselves in sparcely-maintained, but prominently used infrastructure.
Often, such infrastructure takes the form of small, little-known libraries handling specific functionality for larger, well-known projects.
One such example is [mutt](https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt.git) and [CVE-2023-4874](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4874).

Understand this bug, understand the software around it, and trigger the crash.
If you can segfault the program, you will earn the flag!
