Bugs often rear themselves in sparsely-maintained, but prominently used
infrastructure. These bugs tend to hide in small utilities or libraries that
sit quietly inside build and analysis toolchains, receiving little direct
attention yet being executed by many developers and automated systems. Because
such tools are invoked on untrusted or publicly-supplied files (tooling input,
CI artifacts, third-party payloads), a parsing bug in them can be a powerful
and surprising attack vector.

One such example is `readelf` from GNU Binutils and CVE-2021-20294. In binutils
version 2.35, `readelf` contained a flaw in its ELF-parsing logic that can lead
to a stack-based buffer overflow when `readelf` processes a specially crafted
ELF file.  An attacker who convinces a victim to run `readelf` on such a file
could cause an out-of-bounds write, potentially crashing the program or
enabling code execution in some environments.

For this exercise you are given a `print_sym_table` program that invokes
`readelf` (version 2.35) to print an ELF's symbol table. Your task is to
understand how the program handles ELF input, find the vulnerability, and
trigger the crash by presenting a crafted ELF file to the program. If you can
make the program segfault under that invocation, you will earn the flag.
